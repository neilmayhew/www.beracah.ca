… the Valley of Praise.

The name Beracah (sometimes spelled Berakah) comes from 2 Chronicles 20: 26 in the Bible. A powerful army was coming against the people of Judah, God’s chosen people, to take the land God had given them. The Israelites prayed to God saying “we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” (20:12). God replied by saying “Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s” (20: 17).

It is my belief that the challenges we face at times in our lives can seem like a vast army against which we feel powerless. Whatever your faith beliefs, my (often silent) focus is on God while you are meeting with me for counselling. I combine my theology with psychology to bring a holistic approach to my work with you.

The story in 2 Chronicles 20 continues as the people of God go out to face the army, only to find that there had been in-fighting and all the men were dead. They then “assembled in the Valley of Berakah where they praised the Lord” (20: 26).

It is my prayer that God will be with you in your challenges and that he will defeat your enemy, whatever that is.
