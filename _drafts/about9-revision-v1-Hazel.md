As a member of an international Christian mission agency for the past 20 years, Hazel, who is originally from England, spent time in Kenya and Texas before coming to Canada. She is married with three adult sons.

Her earlier career as a nurse together with her later work in personnel with the mission agency have been good avenues for her compassionate and approachable nature, and her love for getting alongside people, supporting them in lifeâ€™s difficult circumstances.

Hazel has experience in interviewing, debriefing, mentoring and career counselling. She has also completed Level 1 training in Gottman Method Couples Therapy, and has some training in spiritual direction.

She has a special passion for counselling individuals and families in missions, ministry and church leadership roles.
