Debriefing……… Counselling……….Listening Skills Workshops………

***Debriefing***: as a missionary you will have experienced many unique stressors while in your cross-cultural setting and in addition to that, coming back to your passport country or culture can bring many challenges. You may be finding that your families, friends and churches are having difficulty understanding what your life has been like and aren’t giving you the time, space and care that you need to process all your experiences.

Debriefing in a relaxed, supportive setting with someone who has overseas experience and will listen and care can be vital to emotional and spiritual vitality as you transition back to your passport country. Debriefing gives you an opportunity to process the disappointments, failures, trauma and losses while also celebrating all that has been good. It will help you make sense of your experiences and emotions and it will restore your sense of purpose and joy.

Even if you have been debriefed by your mission agency or church you may find a more in-depth, experiential and reflective debriefing helpful.

Individual, couple or family debriefing is available online and can take place during a morning, a full day, or a couple of days. I’m happy to discuss the options with you.

***Counselling***: from time to time we all need some extra help dealing with life’s challenges, but for those in missions it can be hard to know where to go and who to talk to. Who will understand your unique stressors? Who will handle your **real** thoughts and feelings? As someone who has been in missions work for more than 20 years I can hear your story with understanding and compassion.

***Listening skills workshops***: anyone working in member care roles will agree that listening is a very valuable gift they give to the members. But listening, good listening, is a skill that requires self-awareness, discipline, and intentionality. Ask me more about what this would look like for your member care team.
