Sessions are approximately 60 minutes (90 minutes for couples).

The standard fee for an individual session is $85 ($95 for couples)

I understand that cost may be a concern to you and in that case I can offer you a sliding scale based on your income, as my desire is to provide a service that is accessible to you whatever your circumstances. Alternatively, if you are a member of a church, mission or ministry agency, your faith community may be able to help you with the costs of counselling.
