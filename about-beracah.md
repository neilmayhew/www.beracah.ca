… the Valley of Blessing/Valley of Praise

The name Beracah (sometimes spelled Berakah)comes from 2 Chronicles 20: 26 in the Bible. The people of Israel had been afraid of the approaching armies who were coming to drive them out of their land. The Israelites prayed to God saying “we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” (20:12). God replied, saying “Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s” (20: 17). After praying and fasting they marched out against the armies, no doubt in fear and trepidation, but also with God's words in their ears, and singing and praising God.  As they came closer to the place where the armies were they saw that they had turned against each other and everyone had been destroyed.  All that was left for the Israelites to do was to collect the plunder. They then assembled in the valley and praised God, calling the valley the valley of Beracah. 

(The whole chapter of 2 Chronicles 20 is well worth reading to get the fuller context for this story)

It is my belief that the challenges we face at times in our lives can seem like a vast army against which we feel powerless, we "do not know what to do". 

I pray that like the Israelites you will be able to put your focus on God, and that you will experience Him with you in your work of defeating your 'enemy', whatever that is.
