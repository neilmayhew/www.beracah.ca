As a member of an international Christian mission agency for 20 years, Hazel, who is originally from England, spent time in Kenya and Texas before moving to Canada. She is married with three adult third-culture sons and two Canadian daughters-in-law. 
Her earlier career as a nurse, together with her later work in personnel with the mission agency, have been a good match for her compassionate and approachable nature, as well as her love for getting alongside people and supporting them in life’s difficult circumstances and challenges.

Hazel earned her MA in Counselling from Providence Theological Seminary and had her own private counselling practice for 12 years. She also has some training in spiritual direction.

Hazel has now retired from her counselling practice and is focusing on writing projects. Her passion continues to be to help people experience the healing love of God.
